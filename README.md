# Decibel Meter

Without consistent and strict control, many classrooms may devolve into loud and playful settings. In consequence, this deteriorates the learning abilities of the students. This project works to create a sound monitoring system that helps classrooms self regulate noise levels. It does not record any audio, share data, or make any internet connections.

In the future, this program will be able to provide a customizable amount of "lives" for the students. This will help take a burden off of the shoulders of teachers and allow for them to maintain a strong educational environment without straining themselves.


## Roadmap

[x] Create a timeline to display an averaged sound overtime

[-] Implement the lives system, along with a changing background and audio warnings at a customizable interval

[x] Implement a buttons system, which will hold support for incrementing or decrementing lives, pausing, muting, etc.

[-] Create a pop-off setting menu, which would allow the changing of key variable

[-] Implement saving and loading from files, especially a config
